Prime factors are the combination of the smallest prime numbers that, when multiplied
together, will produce the original number. Consider the following example:
• Prime factors of 7 are: 7
• Prime factors of 30 are: 5 x 3 x 2
• Prime factors of 40 are: 5 x 2 x 2 x 2
• Prime factors of 50 are: 5 x 5 x 2
Create a workspace/solution named PrimeFactors to contain three projects: a class library
with a method named PrimeFactors that, when passed an int variable as a parameter, returns
a string showing its prime factors; a unit tests project; and a console application to use it.

To keep it simple, you can assume that the largest number entered will be 1,000.
Use the debugging tools and write unit tests to ensure that your function works correctly
with multiple inputs and returns the correct output.
